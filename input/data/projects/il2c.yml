Title: A translator for ECMA-335 CIL/MSIL to C language.
Description: Better predictability for runtime costs, better human readability for the IL2C translated C source code. Very tiny footprint requirements, we are thinking about how fit between tiny embedded system and large system with many resources. Better code/runtime portability, minimum requirements are only C99 compiler. Better interoperabilities for exist C libraries, we can use standard .NET interop technics (likely P/Invoke.) Contains seamless building system for major C toolkits, for example: CMake system, Arduino IDE, VC++ ...

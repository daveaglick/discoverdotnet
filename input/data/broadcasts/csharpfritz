Description: Panel Content  My name is Jeff, and I write code for a living. I'm a big fan of building and working with websites, as well as a handful of games from Blizzard like Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch. You can find me on Twitter at csharpfritz and you can read my blog  During the day, and on my stream, I write .NET code for websites and applications. I hope you join me to learn more about .NET, .NET Core, and Visual Studio.  This stream is not the property of my employer, even though I may bring some colleagues on to talk about their projects.  I will match the first $500 of subscriptions and cheers, my employer will match any subscription and cheer, and the total proceeds will be donated to Girl Develop It, an organization that teaches women and underserved minorities how to write software.  The stream schedule is maintained in an online calendar you can subscribe to.  Past stream recordings are on my YouTube channel
